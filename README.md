API Gateway (Node.js)
A lightweight, performant, and scalable API gateway built with Node.js and Express. This project is in active development and serves as the core for several microservices, providing a single entry point for our distributed system.

Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to create a centralized gateway that handles common concerns such as authentication, rate limiting, and request logging, allowing downstream microservices to focus solely on their business logic.

Centralization: Provide a single, stable endpoint for all client applications.

Security: Offload authentication and authorization from individual services.

Performance: Ensure low latency and high throughput.

Scalability: Design to be horizontally scalable in a containerized environment.

Technology Stack
This project leverages a modern, robust set of technologies:

Node.js: For the asynchronous, non-blocking runtime environment.

Express.js: As the web application framework.

JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For stateless authentication.

Redis: For efficient, scalable rate limiting.

Winston: For flexible and powerful logging.

Features
Rate Limiting: Robust IP-based rate limiting using an in-memory or Redis-backed store to prevent abuse and ensure service availability.

Request Logging: Detailed middleware for logging incoming requests, response times, status codes, and user agents. Logs can be output to the console or a file.

Authentication Middleware: Secure routes with JWT-based authentication. The gateway validates the token before proxying the request to the target service.

Dynamic Routing: Routes incoming requests to the appropriate downstream microservice based on the request path. The routing map is easily configurable.

Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/xavyriv/api-gateway-node.git](https://github.com/xavyriv/api-gateway-node.git)

# Navigate into the project directory
cd api-gateway-node

# Install NPM packages
npm install

# Run the server
npm start

The server will start on http://localhost:3000.

Configuration
The application is configured using environment variables. Create a .env file in the root of the project:

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# JWT Secret Key
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here

# Rate Limiter Configuration
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=15 * 60 * 1000 # 15 minutes
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100 # Max requests per window per IP
